# MergeSort-Algorithm
Developed a NetBeans application showcasing a descending order sorting algorithm (e.g., merge sort) on a predefined collection of 10 items. Utilized a custom class, MyArrayList, extending ArrayList and integrating the sorting algorithm. Additionally, enhanced the application to measure and display the algorithm's efficiency through the total number of comparisons performed for the given item collection.
